Decorator

With the usage of lambda expression, code got more clear and more concise, and inheritance was not used here to 
build the decorators. It is obvious to see that the use of lambda expressions, makes the additional classes for 
decorators redundant. Additional classes are not needed anymore. Instead, simply specify additional behavior using 
lambda expression. However, there is support for finding the decorator again for re-use. If you have a concrete 
decorator class, you can reuse it next time also.
